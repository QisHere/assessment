To run the code, first install the Anaconda and navigate to the directory where the notebooks, input data and environment.yml file are located.

Then create the environment using the "environment.yml" file and this command in anaconda prompt: conda env create -f environment.yml

Then activate the environment using this command in anaconda prompt: conda activate hsbc

The solution is split into 2 files:

1) data_exploration.ipynb - this has all the steps taken to explore the data
2) feature_engineering_and_modelling.ipynb - this has all the steps taken to engineer the feature and model the data

Both notebooks can be run independently by running the cells within sequencitially.
